Description
-----------

    Amoebax is a free multi-platform match-3 puzzle game where the objective
is to beat your opponent in a battle by filling their grid up to the top with
garbage.

    You can play as Kim or Tom against six cute creatures controlled by the
amoebas or you can play up to four players in a tournament to check out who is
the amoebas' master.
