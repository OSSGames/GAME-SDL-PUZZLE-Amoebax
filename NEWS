  "Go!!" for a short period of time.
- The normal mode can be played either as Kim or as Tom.
- The main amoeba of the falling pair (the amoeba that does not rotate) is now
  visibly different by a glowing silhouette.
- Smooth rotating animations for the falling pair of amoebas and
  animation for the queued amoebas.
- Smooth movement for the pairs waiting on the left/right side of the grid.
- The game now is over when the 3rd column is filled, not when the other
  columns are filled.

  more importance to the steps rather the number of removed amoebas.
